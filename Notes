Rust is systems programming language

Systems programming language : 
Low-level system development, 
such as writing operation systemm, device drivers,
compliers, game engine , or embedded system 


Rust Balance :
    -Speed
    -Safty
    -Concurrency
    -Portability : complie once and run everywhere

Memory Managment :

# LowLevel language like c++ provide functions for memory allcation

rust uses ownership borrowing

CARGO package manager : is similar to npm for node or pip for python




test.rs file :
You will need to complie the file everytime you run
using this commands :
    rustc test.rs
then run it
    ./test

but for projects it will complie auto..
    cargo new projectName

Rust has two types of format :
    Debuggable Format
    Display Format


using strings u will need to convert it to string :
    "Mohamed".to_string()

# rust is fast because it is close to the hardware
# rust compiled to machine code in no time the same thing as c and c ++
# but with no garbage collection and automatic memory management 

when u declare a variable (string) is going to be allocated on the heap because it is dynamic allocaton


Rust dataType is by default is immutable that means u cannot change it
so u will need to defined the variable using mut so u can change it 
    let mut variable: dataType= value;


&str (Sting Slice) are immutable has spicific size
